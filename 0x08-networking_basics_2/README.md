# 0x08. Networking Basics #2

This project focuses on networking concepts such as localhost, IP addresses, and network interfaces, along with practical usage of Bash scripting to manipulate and explore networking on an Ubuntu server.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without Google:
- What is localhost/127.0.0.1
- What is 0.0.0.0
- What is /etc/hosts
- How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version 0.7.0 via `apt-get`) without any errors
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does

## Tasks

### 0. Change your home IP
**File:** `0-change_your_home_IP`

Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the following requirements:
- `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.2`
- `facebook.com` resolves to `8.8.8.8`

Example:
```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.012 ms
sylvain@ubuntu$ sudo ./0-change_your_home_IP
sylvain@ubuntu$ ping localhost
PING localhost (127.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.012 ms
