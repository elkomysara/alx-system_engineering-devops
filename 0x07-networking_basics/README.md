# Networking Basics

This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of networking, including the OSI model, different types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, protocols such as TCP and UDP, and basic network troubleshooting techniques like ping. The goal is to understand these core concepts, which are crucial for anyone working with networks and the internet.

## Key Concepts

- **OSI Model**: A conceptual model that defines how applications can communicate over a network through seven layers, from the physical to the application layer.
- **Types of Networks**: Including LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and the Internet.
- **MAC and IP Addresses**: Identifiers used to uniquely identify devices on a network.
- **TCP and UDP Protocols**: Two main transport layer protocols used to manage data transfer over networks.
- **Ports**: Entry points into a network device, crucial for understanding how different services communicate.
- **ICMP and Ping**: Used for testing network connectivity.

## Tasks

### 0. OSI Model
- **Description**: Answer questions related to the OSI model, including what it is and how it's organized.

### 1. Types of Network
- **Description**: Identify different types of networks such as LAN, WAN, and the Internet based on various scenarios.

### 2. MAC and IP Address
- **Description**: Answer questions about MAC addresses and IP addresses, understanding their significance in networking.

### 3. UDP and TCP
- **Description**: Understand the differences between the TCP and UDP protocols and when each is used.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports
- **Description**: Write a Bash script to display listening ports, including the program's PID and name for each socket.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network?
- **Description**: Write a Bash script that pings an IP address five times and checks if a device is on the network.
